										<h2 class="title" >1991-1997</h2>
										<p style="text-align: center;">Born and raised in small but still bustling Lima, Ohio my formative years were spent torn between the analog and the digital. Exposed to camping and the outdoor life from birth then exposed to video games and personal computing by age 4. This early relationship allowed me to blossom an appreciation for not only nature and technology but the way we interact with both.</p>
										<br>
										<p style="text-align: center;">By age five I was already articulating my way around technology and trying to disassemble anything I could get my hands on to pass the time. This early curiosity was piqued after beginning grade school when my father gave me a hand-me-down desktop tower and keyboard (to be fair he did give me a mouse, I just had lost the ball and it was quite a challenge to navigate), this led to learning to use windows 95 using only keyboard commands. When not glued to the screen of my PC I spent my time either camping and learning survival skills with my grandparents or spending the summer days helping my great grandmother and grandfather tend to their home garden and orchard. </p>

										<h2 class="title" >1997-2006</h2>
										<p style="text-align: center;">From grade four my academic life was spent attending public school but enrolled in a program called the Computer Science Magnet. This was significant in the direction I would take in life as this program had a focus on STEM classes which was key to developing the skills needed to approach problems analytically and critically using old and new technologies. Computer classes in school would expand the knowledge I was building at home by using the desktop to reinforce lessons from earlier in the day (usually by practicing what I learned at school inadvertently through my curiosity). Otherwise, I would occupy my time playing video games and toying around with Windows to see what system files/registry entries I would need to alter to make the operating system work how I wanted it to.</p>
										<br>
										<p style="text-align: center;">As time passed my obsession began to include devouring any books (fiction or non-fiction) I could get my hands onto. My time increasingly began to be torn between reading or being attached to a monitor of some sort tweaking the operating system of the machine I was using. Even during middle school, I was known in the family for being the first one to have a solution to any problem regarding computers and technology in general.</p>
										<br>
										<p style="text-align: center;">When not glued to a device my free time was spent with my other great grandmother playing cards or watching old television shows as she would recount the tales of her youth during the great depression (I remember still her being adamant that Phyllis Diller used to babysit for the family before she left lima for Hollywood or the story of her renting from a Madame back in the 40s).</p>

										<h2 class="title" >2006-2013</h2>
										<p style="text-align: center;">By early 2007 I had developed a curiosity for HTML and CSS (although admittedly at this time it was very superficial and was helped heavily by Dreamweaver) and published my first website. HTTP://www.thelittlehaven.org was a small personal blog that housed a few flash games. While mostly a personal project to bypass school filters and allow me the ability to play games while in class it shared similarities and design principles with this site today including a desire to use minimal JavaScript.</p>
										<br>
										<p style="text-align: center;">The website although short lived only helped my fixation on technology to grow deeper and more expansive. By the time I graduated High School in 2009 I was maintaining a full featured Hackintosh as well as a Windows/Ubuntu multiboot system made of salvaged parts from old business towers. Graduating led to a desire for something I could call my own and after a long summer of saving up, I built my first computer using all new parts.</p>
										<br>
										<p style="text-align: center;">This brought a foundational knowledge into practical application and opened my eyes to the many possibilities in front of me as well as the many problems that can arise. I quickly dove down the rabbit hole as did many system builders before me and before I knew it, I was already designing my next system. This came into fruition in late 2012 when I built the computer that would last me until 2020.</p>

										<h2 class="title" >2013-Current</h2>
										<p style="text-align: center;">Around 2013 I took a backseat on keeping up with bleeding-edge technologies and instead focused more on the theory and math behind popular technologies. The journey down this rabbit hole has led me to many more questions than I could find answers to. I continued to pick up bits and pieces of new technology as they became mainstream and continued to learn bits and pieces on my own.</p>
										<br>
										<p style="text-align: center;">Deciding to take the driver seat on my passion in 2019 I enrolled in the 2020-2021 Apollo Career Center Network and Cloud Technologies program. Over the year I gained further in-depth knowledge of Windows, Mac OS, and Linux. I spent time learning the ins-and-outs of VirtualBox which in turn began a delve into different Linux distributions (finally settling on the wonderfully featured yet lightweight Mint OS).  The practical hands-on education as well as experienced instruction allowed me to get a good foundation for how to approach, solve, and document problems realistically. I used this education to obtain not only my certificate of completion but also my CompTIA ITF+ and A+ 1001 certificates.</p>
										<br>
										<p style="text-align: center;">Now bright-eyed and bushy eared I approach 2021 with a passion to obtain my remaining certifications as I enter the field. </p>
