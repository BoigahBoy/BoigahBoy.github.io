										<h2 class="title" >Who I am.</h2>
										<p class="indent">At a glance I'm a graduate of the Cloud and Network Technologies program at Apollo Career Center obtaining my CompTIA ITF+, and A+ 1001 certifications. Ambitions to obtain my CompTIA A+ 1002, Cloud Essentials+ as well as certifications for Linux and Python. A diligent analytical person who is self-driven to stay current with technological innovations. . .</p>

														<summary><h3>Early Years</h3></summary>
														<p class="indent">Born and raised in small but still bustling Lima, Ohio I spent my days torn between the analog and the digital. Exposed to camping and the outdoor life from birth allowed me to blossom an appreciation for nature and the elements while also teaching me core survival skills, discipline and a work hard play hard lifestyle.</p>
														<p class="indent">By age three I was already articulating my way around technology and either playing video games or trying to disassemble anything I could get my hands on to pass the time. Shortly after beginning school my father gave me a hand-me-down desktop tower (with no working mouse I might add, try learning to use windows 95 using only keyboard commands and shortcuts).</p>
														<p class="indent">The summer days of these early years were spent helping my great grandfather tend to his farm and small orchard, learning practical life lessons as well as critical thinking when we would need to solve a problem using limited resources. Early winters consisted of spending time with my great grandmother playing cards or watching old television shows as she would recount the tales of her youth during the great depression or playing video games and spending time toying around with Windows to see what I could do to make the operating system work how I wanted it to.</p>
														<p class="indent">As I grew, I spent my time either fixated on my Nintendo Gameboy (so much so my father called it my "life support"), reading any book fiction or non-fiction I could get my hands onto, or attached to a monitor of some sort tweaking the operating system of the machine I was using. This led to me becoming the go-to resource for any technical knowledge or help regarding almost any technology my friends or family owned.</p>
													</details>
													<details>
														<summary><h3>High School and Beyond</h3></summary>
														<p class="indent">My fixation on technology only grew deeper and more expansive the more I applied my knowledge and continued to learn new information and follow up and coming technologies. By the time I was graduating High School in 2009 I was already operating and maintaining several personal projects including one hackintosh machine, a Linux machine, as well as maintaining a personal blog and the HTML/CSS that it was built upon (this blog unfortunately has been dead for so long someone else has bought the domain name that I was using at the time).</p>
														<p class="indent">Upon finishing my first PC build involving all new parts I began to take a backseat on the I.T. side of technology and instead focused more on the theory and math behind my favorite technologies. Through this journey I began to learn the basics of python and C++.</p>
														<p class="indent">Remaining quiet I decided to take the driver seat on my passion in 2019 and enrolled in the 2020-2021 Apollo Career Center Network and Cloud Technologies program and used it to obtain not only an education but certifications as well. I was able to despite the Coronavirus pandemic successfully receive my CompTIA ITF+ and A+ 1001 certificates. The practical hands-on education also allowed me to get a good feel for how to approach problems in a realistic way.</p>
														<p class="indent">Now bright eyed and bushy eared I approach the field in 2021 with a passion to make a difference and help influence the way we do things as IT professionals. </p>
